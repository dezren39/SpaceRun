// .sks files are archived in SKEmitterNode instances. We need to retrieve a copy of that node by loading it from the app bundle. In order to mimic the API that Apple uses for sound actions, we will build a Swift extension to add a new method onto the SKEmitterNode class.

//NOTE: extensions were called categories in Obj C

extension String {
    var length: Int {
        return self.characters.count
    }
}

//Now let's exten the SKEmitterNode class by adding a helper method to it named nodewithFile()
extension SKEmitterNode {
    class func nodeWithFile(_ fileName: String) -> SKEmitterNode? {
            //break apart the passed-in fileName into a baseName and it's extension. If the passed in fileName has no extension, add an extension of "sks")
        let baseName = (fileName as NSString).deletingPathExtension
        var fileExtension = (fileName as NSString).pathExtension
        
        if fileExtension.length == 0 {
            fileExtension = "sks"
        }
        
        // Grab the main bundle of our app and ask for the path to a resource using our baseName and fileExtension
        if let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: baseName, ofType: fileExtension) {
            //particle effects in SK are archived when created and so must be unarchived.
            
            let node = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(withFile: path) as! SKEmitterNode

//We want to add explosions for the two collisions that occur for torpedos vs obstacles and obstacles vs ship
